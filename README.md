# CTF Writeups – Beyond the Flag

This repository contains my cybersecurity CTF writeups, with a focus on understanding **why vulnerabilities exist**, not just how to exploit them.

---

## My Hope for this Project

There are many writeups online that document the steps required to obtain a flag. 
The goal for this project is to build deeper technical understanding, and go beyond just completing challenges.

---

## How it's Different

Each writeup will typically include:

- A clear enumeration and exploitation attack chain
- Technical explanation of the vulnerability and its cause
- Remediation and defensive considerations  

---

## Why This Matters

When I started tackling CTF challenges, writeups were my primary resource for developing my methodology and understanding exploitation techniques. Very few of the resources I consulted were actually technical, while the majority were simply a list of instructions. Through this, I hope to raise the bar for technical writeups and create a more professional and informed CTF community.
